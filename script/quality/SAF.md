# SAF Regression Checks

Run only against an emulator with the matching debug APK and androidTest APK.
The instrumentation checks the hardware name before creating UUID-scoped
fixtures. It does not reset the Rime user dictionary or run orphan cleanup
against the application's live Rime data directory.

```sh
adb -s emulator-5560 shell am instrument -w -r -e saf true \
  com.osfans.trime.debug.test/com.osfans.trime.StartupResponsivenessInstrumentation
```

Require both `passed=true` and `INSTRUMENTATION_CODE: -1` in the output. The
command's shell exit status alone does not prove an instrumentation test passed.
Use `-r` to retain the result bundle and final code, not only the pretty stream.

`SafCompatibilityProbe` exercises Android `DocumentsContract`, cursors, reliable
pipes, opaque/changing IDs, read-back verification, replacement and rollback
failures, retained recovery data, unsupported rename, incomplete/null listings,
invalid/duplicate names and denied access. The fixture resolver is in-process;
its permission failures are injected, not evidence of real URI-grant behavior.
It also tests Trime's own document provider using an isolated temporary subtree.

For the real system provider, select a newly created `trime-saf-UUID` directory
in the system document picker on the disposable emulator. Pass its granted URI:

```sh
adb -s emulator-5560 shell am instrument -w -r -e saf true \
  -e safTree 'content://com.android.externalstorage.documents/tree/primary%3ADocuments%2Ftrime-saf-UUID' \
  com.osfans.trime.debug.test/com.osfans.trime.StartupResponsivenessInstrumentation
```

This additional probe checks a persisted read/write grant, creates a new child
directory, performs a create/replace/read-back round trip, then removes only that
new child. Repeat after stopping/restarting the app to check persisted access.
Do not substitute a personal data directory or clear an existing emulator.

After closing the picker and force-stopping the test app, repeat with
`-e safRevoke true` and the same `safTree`. This releases only that directory's
persisted grant and requires an actual system `SecurityException` on the next
query. Remaining transient picker grants cause failure, not a false pass.
Re-select the directory before any subsequent round-trip test.

For clipboard-editor visibility, select this build as the default IME and use
`am instrument -w -r -e clip true` with the same runner. This requires editor
window focus, an actual visible `keyboard_view` in the IME accessibility window,
stable bounds for one second, and a nonblank screenshot. The system's IME-insets
visibility flag alone does not prove the asynchronous keyboard has rendered.

## Provider Limits

- Existing files require rename support for safe replacement. Providers lacking
  this capability can receive new files but replacement fails without overwriting
  the original. There is no silent destructive overwrite fallback.
- A loading or failed directory listing aborts the import before orphan cleanup.
  Retry after the remote provider has completed loading.
- Unknown size or timestamp disables the metadata-cache shortcut. Verification
  uses streamed SHA-256 read-back with bounded buffers, not descriptor stat size.
- Failed rollback retains the operation-scoped backup. Subsequent import/cleanup
  skips these recovery artifacts. Never delete them merely to silence an error.
- Duplicate names or repeated document IDs abort traversal. A provider exposing
  the same document under multiple parents is not treated as a plain sync tree.
- Local symbolic links below the sync root are not followed, including links
  back into that root; otherwise aliases could bypass user-dictionary exclusions.
- Passing the fixture and system-provider probes does not establish compatibility
  with every third-party cloud provider, OEM picker, or Android release. Record
  exactly which emulator/API/provider was exercised in the build report.
